# Synchronization
These are various synchronization methods I implemented in my synchronization project to avoid race condition. It was a bank account that must be withdrawn from and deposited into a fixed amount a very large number of times and ensuring numerical stability of the bank account after the transactions which meant avoid shared memory access during race condition. The methods used were Peterson's solution, Locaks, Semaphores and Block Level Synching

Uploaded are the 4 main classes that needed to be worked on as well as in every folder copies of the classes but fixed with a certain synchronization method.
